# processpymap
This is an item process map console application, type in the name of the items that you want to use to create an even more important item and caculate how much of that item you can make with your current amount on hand, amount needed to create desirable item, and amount of item made per craft. The purpose of this is to see how my python programming styles and habits differs from my c++ programming styles and habits. Another goal of this project is to make teach my self problem solving through the use of recursion (making a function call itself until a certain condition is met, in which case the function would complete its runtime)
